# Introduction: Matrix
Here we present you a program performing Matrix calculations. Simple ones are adding and multiplying matrix. Complex one is reversing matrice. For the later, we have developped an original algorithm to achieve it. Check on code to analyze it (inversionManager Method). This method is inspired from our class mathematics course, a formal one. One funny thing in this app is that you can use voice to perform calculations.  

# Features of the program  
This matrix calculator allow you to:  
- *add* two matrix  
- *multiply* two matrix  
- *reverse* a matrice  
- Enable *voice* to use the calculator
